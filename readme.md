MonetXR
by Yoni Binstock

An education experience to teach students about the artwork of Claude Monet. 

This site uses WebXR API to detect if the device is AR/VR capable and then renders the appropiate view. 

In VR, the user is situated on a bridge overlooking a river with Monet's paintings ahead. The user can click on the next arrow
to move to the next painting and read the description. 

In AR, the user can scan vertical surfaces and then place the painting on the wall.
